        <p>
          Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're
          looking for environment setup instructions, they've moved to their own
          section. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,
          Native Components, React, and more!
        </p>

        <h2 id="Components">Core Components</h2>

        <p>
          React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS
          applications using React and the app platform‚Äôs native capabilities.
          With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs
          as well as to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using
          React components: bundles of reusable, nestable code. You can learn
          more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
          components work in React Native.
        </p>

        <h2 id="Fundamentals">React Fundamentals</h2>

        <p>
          React Native runs on React, a popular open source library for building
          user interfaces with JavaScript. To make the most of React Native, it
          helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or
          can serve as a refresher course.
        </p>

        <p>We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            + components. The rest of this introduction to React uses cats in
            its examples: friendly, approachable creatures that need names and a
            cafe to work in.
          </li>
          <li>
            + JSX. React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you write
            elements inside JavaScript like so: &lt;Text&gt; Hello, I am your
            cat!&lt;Text&gt;. The React docs have a comprehensive guide to JSX
            you can refer to learn even more. Because JSX is JavaScript, you can
            use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a name for the cat,
            name, and embedding it with curly braces inside &lt;Text&gt;.
          </li>
          <li>+ props. Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</li>
          <li>
            + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to
            configure how components render, state is like a component‚Äôs
            personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that
            changes over time or that comes from user interaction. State gives
            your components memory!
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="Text">Handling Text Input</h2>

        TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has
        an onChangeText prop that takes a function to be called every time the
        text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to be
        called when the text is submitted. For example, let's say that as the
        user types, you're translating their words into a different language. In
        this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the
        sentence "Hello there Bob" would be translated as "üçïüçïüçï".
